A dead-simple QoL mod that adds up to 3 more loadout slots (amount can be configured).

Note: Make sure you remove all items from the loadout slots before disabling the mod! Loadout menus 4 through 6 are only accessible while this mod is enabled.

Links to a GitHub and Discord can be found on the workshop page.
